                Music is an art form that combines either vocal or instrumental sounds, sometimes both, using form,
                harmony, and expression of emotion to convey an idea. Music represents many different forms that play
                key factors in cultures around the world. A description of music, when asked by musicians, is quite
                challenging for them to put into a words. There is something unique, unto each artist, which music makes
                people feel a specific way in the world. John Coltrane described his music as, ''My music is the
                spiritual expression of what I am my faith, my knowledge, my being. When you begin to see the
                possibilities of music, your desire to do something really good for people, to help humanity free itself
                from its hang ups. I want to speak to their souls.''

                Music is made or created by using sound from human voices or instruments. Sounds are grouped together to
                form melody, harmony, and rhythm, in combination together and recorded they become a song that is
                composed. Some music is created spontaneously, and some music is composed over years or decades,
                depending upon which the composer chooses. The composition of music itself is made up of the vast
                grouping of notes, phrases, melodies, rhythms, harmonies, and lyrics, which all form a singular piece.
                The word, composition, often refers to instrumental music and the word, song, lends itself to be a
                musical piece that has lyrics or words that accompany the music.

                The history of music is a lengthy topic which requires much depth and time. Music is an ancient art form
                that began during prehistoric times. It carries with it a history for each human culture throughout
                time. Although there are many varied definitions of music, it is a cultural universal because every
                culture throughout time and history has made music a primary component of life. For ages, music was
                passed down through oral tradition on a fundamental level; but for formal purposes, recorded music began
                with the written tradition by medieval monks during 500 AD to 1400.
